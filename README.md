This repository houses the example code for my "Stages of Learning Webpack Pt. 2" article on 
  [Dev.to](https://dev.to). The repo is separated into different branches, each branch holding
  _similar_ content w/ modifications relevant to the name of that branch.

-   Loader: Adds TypeScript + TSLoader.
    -   Loader/Babel: Duplicate of loader, using Babel-Loader
